Absolutely, I understand now. Here's a similar structured text prompt for your digital clock project:

**1. HTML Structure:**

Create the basic HTML structure for the digital clock:
- Set up a container to hold the clock display.
- Inside the container, create elements to display hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Include a button to toggle between 12-hour and 24-hour formats.

**2. JavaScript Logic:**

Implement the JavaScript logic for the digital clock:
- Define variables to store the clock elements and format preference.
- Create a function to fetch the current time using the `Date` object.
- Write a function to update the clock display with the current time.
- Implement a function to toggle between 12-hour and 24-hour formats.

**3. Event Listener:**

Add an event listener to enable format toggling:
- Attach a click event listener to the format toggle button.
- Call the format toggle function to switch between 12-hour and 24-hour formats when the button is clicked.

**4. Real-Time Updates:**

Ensure the clock updates in real-time:
- Use the `setInterval` function to regularly call the clock update function every second.
- This will ensure the displayed time is always current and accurate.

**5. Styling with CSS:**

Apply CSS styles to improve the appearance of the digital clock:
- Style the clock container, text elements, and format toggle button.
- Choose fonts, colors, and layout to create an aesthetically pleasing design.

**6. Project Setup:**

Provide instructions for setting up and running the project:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the digital clock.
- Explore the codebase to understand the JavaScript logic and CSS styling.

**7. Customization:**

Encourage customization and further development:
- Experiment with different styles and layouts to personalize the clock.
- Explore additional features such as date display or time zone selection.

**8. License:**

Specify the project's open-source license for sharing and modification:
- Add a section indicating that the project is licensed under a specific license (e.g., MIT License).

Feel free to adjust and expand each section based on your project's specific requirements and your preferred level of detail.
